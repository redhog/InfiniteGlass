## Window updates

Some graphics drivers require rebinding a window pixmap (manually
update) for each change of window content, while other drivers don't.
While InfiniteGlass tries to auto-detect this, it sometimes fails. To
override the auto-detection, you can set the following environment
variable.

`GLASS_GLX_REBIND_PIXMAP=1`
