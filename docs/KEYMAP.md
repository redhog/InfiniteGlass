# Key bindings

Key bindings are implemented by glass-input. They are specified in [~/.config/glass/input.yml](../glass-config-init/glass_config_init/input.yml).

All key bindings require the Windows key (Super_L) to be pressed, in
addition to some other keys or mouse buttons.

* Shift makes the action "smaller"
* Alt makes an action operate on a window

* PageUp/PageDown zooms in/out
* Arrow keys pan
* Arrow keys+Alt+Control resizes a window

* Home zooms to a specific state
* Space launches the main menu
* Escape toggles the sidebar
* C closes a window
* S sleeps an application
* T tiles all visible windows
* F searches for a window by title


Mouse bindings:

* Button2 counts as Button1+Control
* Moving the mouse while holding Button1 counts as Arrow keys
  * Moving the mouse while holding Button2 counts as Arrow keys+Control
* Scroll wheel (Button4, Button5) counts as PageUp / PageDown
