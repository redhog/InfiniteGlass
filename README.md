Features:

* Windows are glued to an infinite desktop to some coordinates and size
* Window pixel resolution is independent of their size on the desktop
* The user can zoom / pan to any view of the desktop
* There are shortcut commands to zoom to a window, and to make a window have a 1:1 resolution to the screen
* Window placement is stored between sessions
  * Windows that are closed leave a ghost window in their place that can be moved, resized and deleted.
  * When a window with the same name reappears, it takes the place of the ghost window if it still exists.
  * Ghost windows are stored in a file between sessions.
* Window content / application state is stored between sessions for supported clients
  * Applications supporting the XSM protocol can be closed and saved and later restored, in the same session or another.
* Infinitely zoomable SVG for buttons etc
  * A window can display an SVG image instead of content, and the SVG will render to the current screen resolution, no matter the zoom level.

# Installation

Tested on: Ubuntu-MATE 18.04 LTS Bionic Beaver.

Requires OpenGL version 3.0 or higher with support for GLSL 3.30, and pretty much all modern X extensions, including their development headers. To install all dependencies:

    sudo apt install -y $(cat /dependencies.txt)

To install InfiniteGlass on your machine

    sudo make install

or, if you want to be able to edit the python files in in place without rerunning the install command:

    sudo make devinstall
   
Note that this does not differ from a the above make install with regards to how the non-python binaries are installed.

Once installed, you should be able to select InfiniteGlass among the available sessions when logging in.

# Testing

It is also possible to try the window manager inside a window using the Xephyr X server, without installing anything. To do so, simply run

    make

If your Linux distribution does not have the right libraries or versions of libraries (e.g. X extensions, OpenGL version...) easily installable, you can test the same using a docker container! Just run

    make run-in-docker

# Configuration

Whichever method for running it you use, the first time you run the window manager, a set of default config files will be added to your ~/.config/glass directory. These files can be safely edited, but will be re-instated if deleted.

# Unit- & integration-tests

    make all
    pip install nose2
    nose2 -s tests -v
